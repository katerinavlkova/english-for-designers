# My featured projects:
## 01: Café Letka 
[2024] [Visual Identity] 
I created a new visual identity for Café Letka. The goal was to make the design more modern while keeping the café’s unique feel. The new look is used for the café’s logo, menu, social media, and other materials.  I also created hand-drawn illustrations that the café can use in their visuals.

I chose only black and white colors to complementa the café's colorful interior and to reflect the idea of black coffee.

## 02: Karpuchina gallery 
[2024] [App Design] 
Karpuchina Gallery is a small Prague gallery focused on new artists. I designed a mobile app to make its art more accessible. The app lets users browse artworks, view past exhibitions, and check the event calendar.

The design is simple, modern, and easy to use, matching the gallery’s unique style.

This project helped more people connect with the gallery and its art in a new way.
