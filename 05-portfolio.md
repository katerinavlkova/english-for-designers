# About me:
> I’m Kateřina Vlková, a graphic designer who believes good design should always have a purpose. I specialize mainly in working on brand identities and digital designs.

Hi! I’m Kateřina Vlková, a graphic designer who believes every project starts with a story. I focus mainly on creating brand identities and web designs that not only look great but also help businesses connect with their audience.

Currently, I’m finishing my studies in Graphic and Media Design at PSCC, where I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, trying out different design methods and improving my skills. I’m always looking for new ways to learn, grow, and improve my work.

For me, design is about understanding. I take time to learn about each client’s vision, values, and goals so I can create designs that truly represent them. Whether it’s a logo, a website, or an entire brand refresh, I make sure my work is both visually striking and practical.

Let’s collaborate to create a design that tells your story and makes your brand stand out!


# My featured projects:
## 01: Café Letka 
*[2024] [Visual Identity]*

I created a new visual identity for Café Letka. The goal was to make the design more modern while keeping the café’s unique feel. The new look is used for the café’s logo, menu, social media, and other materials.  I also created hand-drawn illustrations that the café can use in their visuals.

I chose only black and white colors to complementa the café's colorful interior and to reflect the idea of black coffee.

## 02: Karpuchina gallery 
*[2024] [App Design]*

Karpuchina Gallery is a small Prague gallery focused on new artists. I designed a mobile app to make its art more accessible. The app lets users browse artworks, view past exhibitions, and check the event calendar.

The design is simple, modern, and easy to use, matching the gallery’s unique style.

This project helped more people connect with the gallery and its art in a new way.

## 03: FAMUFEST
*[2023] [Visual Identity]*

This was a group school project where we collaborated to create the visual identity for the 40th FAMUFEST. The festival focused on the theme of “networks” and how they connect artists, audiences, and the world. Our design was inspired by neural networks in the brain, which influence our emotions and responses to art.

We designed a logo, website, and social media visuals, which were also used in promotional materials. The design reflected the theme of connection and was applied across all festival platforms.
