## **Design should have purpose**:

Design is not just about looking good; it’s mainly about solving problems and meeting people's needs. While making something beautiful is nice, making sure it works well is even more important. Every decision in design, such as choosing colors, layouts, or fonts, should help support the main purpose and communicate the message.


## **Freedom**:

Freedom in design is essential because it lets creativity flow. There are rules that can help guide designers, but these should not restrict their imagination. This freedom allows designers to explore new ideas and take risks, which can lead to exciting and unique solutions that stand out.


## **Typography matters**:

Typography is important because it affects how we read and understand text. Picking the right font and spacing makes the text easier to read and more visually appealing. When the text is well-designed, it catches the reader's attention and keeps them engaged with what they are reading.


## **Learning**:

Learning in design is something that never really stops. Because the design world is always changing, it's important to stay curious and open to new ideas. By keeping up with the latest trends and trying out new tools, designers can continue to improve their skills and make sure their work stays relevant.


## **Simplicity**:

A simple design is often the most effective way to communicate. Having too many details can confuse people, so it’s better to keep things clean and focused. By highlighting only what is essential, designers can make their messages stronger and easier for people to remember.
