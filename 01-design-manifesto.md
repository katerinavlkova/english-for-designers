***Katerina's DESIGN MANIFESTO***

*15.10.2024*

**Design should have purpose**:

Design is not just about looking good; it is about solving problems and meeting needs. Beauty is important, but functionality comes first. Every choice in design, like color, layout, or font, should support the purpose and message.


**Freedom**:

Freedom in design allows creativity to flow. Rules are there to guide us, not to limit us. This freedom allows designers to try new ideas and find unique solutions.


**Typography matters**:

Typography matters because it affects how we read and understand he message. Choosing the right font and spacing makes the text easy to read and visually appealing. Good typography helps express feelings and improves the overall experience.

   
**Learning**:

Learning in design never stops. The field is always changing, so it is important to stay curious and open to new ideas. Keeping up with trends and tools helps designers grow and stay fresh.


**Consistency**:

Consistency is important for creating a smooth experience. When all parts of a design fit well together, it is easier to understand. Consistency is not about repeating the same thing but about making elements work together.


**Simplicity**:

A simple design is often the most effective. Too many details can overwhelm, so it is better to keep things clean and focused. Highlighting only what is essential makes the message stronger and easier to remember.
