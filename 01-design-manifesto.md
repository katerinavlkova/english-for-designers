*11.10.2024*

**Design should have purpose🎯**:

Design should always have a purpose, where aesthetic value is secondary to function. It should aim to solve a problem or meet a specific need. 


**Freedom✨**:

Freedom in design means that rules should not to stand in the way of new ideas but rather encourage them. This freedom enables experimentation, trying new things, and discovering original solutions. 


**Typography matters📝**:

Typography plays a critical role, as it is important for more than just readability; proper use of fonts, spacing, and layout ensures that the message is both clear and visually appealing.

   
**Learning📚**:

Continuous learning is essential in design, as the field is constantly changing. Staying open to new ideas and tools helps to grow and improve skills.


**Consistency🔗**:

Consistency is also key, as it creates a clear and reliable experience, ensuring that all elements of a design work together. This doesn’t mean simple repetition, but rather the creation of patterns that are logical and cohesive.
