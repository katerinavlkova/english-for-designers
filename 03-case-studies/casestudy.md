# Designing Access to Art: A Mobile Experience for Karpuchina Gallery
## Keeping It Quiet — Even on a Screen
Karpuchina Gallery is not loud place. The gallery is quiet, calm, small, and a bit hidden in the center of Prague. It has white walls, old brick ceilings, and soft, simple light. When I started designing an app for them, I didn’t want to change that feeling. I just wanted to bring it into a new form.

## Letting the Space Lead the Design
Before I designed anything, I looked at the space itself. The gallery is small but thoughtful. It has this balance between raw and clean — old structure and modern art. That told me everything: the app had to be simple, minimal, and respectful.

## Art Is for Everyone — The App Had to Be Too
This app wasn’t just for people who already visit the gallery. It was also for anyone who’s curious about art. So I wanted the app to feel open and easy to use. That meant clear design, intuitive interaction, and no pressure.

## The Interface Should Feel Like Walking
The gallery feels like a place where you walk slowly and take your time. So I designed the app to feel similar — no complicated menus or hidden layers. Just clear sections: current shows, calendar, past exhibitions, saved items. The structure is minimal, just like the space itself.
