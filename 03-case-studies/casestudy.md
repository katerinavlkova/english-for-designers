# Designing Access to Art: A Mobile Experience for Karpuchina Gallery
## Keeping It Quiet — Even on a Screen
Karpuchina Gallery is not loud place. The gallery is quiet, calm, small, and a bit hidden in the center of Prague. It has white walls, old brick ceilings, and soft, simple light. When I started designing an app for them, I didn’t want to change that feeling. I just wanted to bring it into a new form.

From the beginning, I knew that translating a physical space like Karpuchina into a mobile format would be less about adding features and more about protecting atmosphere. The app couldn’t be flashy or overwhelming. It had to be gentle, minimal, and respectful — just like the space itself. I was trying to hold space for its mood, its silence, and its understated beauty.

## Letting the Space Lead the Design
Before I designed anything, I looked at the space itself. The gallery is small but thoughtful. It has this balance between raw and clean — old structure and modern art. That told me everything: the app had to be simple, minimal, and respectful.

## Art Is for Everyone — The App Had to Be Too
This app wasn’t just for people who already visit the gallery. It was also for anyone who’s curious about art. So I wanted the app to feel open and easy to use. That meant clear design, intuitive interaction, and no pressure.

## The Interface Should Feel Like Walking
The gallery feels like a place where you walk slowly and take your time. So I designed the app to feel similar — no complicated menus or hidden layers. Just clear sections: current shows, calendar, past exhibitions, saved items. The structure is minimal, just like the space itself.

## Design That Doesn’t Compete With the Art
For font, I chose Roboto because it’s clean and easy to read. The color palette is simple: red, black, and white. I didn’t want the app to compete with the art. It’s there to support it — nothing more.

## Making Chaos Look Simple: The Calendar Challenge
The event calendar turned out to be the most challenging part of the design.
Exhibitions and events often overlap, and it needed to be clear and easy to navigate — without making the user feel lost.

## What’s Next?
> Not a Real App — But It Could Be.

Right now, this is just a concept project, but it was designed with real use in mind. If the project were to continue, I’d love to take it further.
The prototype was made with real exhibitions, real schedules, and real content from the gallery. It's not just a visual mock-up — it’s a framework that could evolve into something functional. If there’s ever a chance to collaborate with the gallery or develop it with a team, I’d be ready. 

## Final Thought
I didn’t want to make an app that looks impressive at first glance.
I wanted to make one that feels invisible — until you need it.
That’s what Karpuchina does so well: it lets the art do the work. And the app should do the same.
