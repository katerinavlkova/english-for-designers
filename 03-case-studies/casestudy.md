## Finding the Way Out: Designing a Visual Identity for Mental Health Support

How do you design one visual voice for both children and adults in need of help ‚Äî without saying too much, too little, or the wrong thing?  
This was a real project for a client ‚Äî a Czech non-profit organization called Cesta z krize (‚ÄúThe Way Out of Crisis‚Äù), which supports people in difficult life situations and focuses on mental health.

The organization operates two anonymous, 24/7, free helplines. One is aimed at adults, the other at children, as well as their parents, teachers, and educators. My task was to create a single visual identity that would resonate with this very wide audience ‚Äî from children to adults ‚Äî across different emotional contexts and communication channels.

## Looking Around First: Market analysis
Before starting the design process, I looked at other Czech organizations working in mental health and crisis support ‚Äî including helplines, non-profits, and psychological services.

What I noticed quickly was that most of them use the same color palette ‚Äî mostly green or blue, often in very similar shades. Their logos are usually typographic with a small graphic detail, or they use a symbol next to the name. But many of those symbols don‚Äôt really say much.

Some identities also felt very outdated ‚Äî like they hadn‚Äôt changed in years and no longer fit today‚Äôs communication needs. 

## The Challenge: Designing for All Minds

Creating a visual system for such a diverse audience meant walking a very fine line.  
The identity needed to feel equally natural to a 10-year-old and a 50-year-old,  without feeling too childish for one or too cold for the other. It also had to approach the topic of mental health with care ‚Äî avoiding clich√©s, heavy symbolism, or anything that might feel too sterile or too emotional.



## Why the Logo Came Last ‚Äî And Why It Made Perfect Sense

The original idea was to create a simple symbol made from a single continuous line ‚Äî a visual element that appears throughout the entire identity.  
I experimented with different concepts and symbols, but none of them felt quite right. Most symbols either felt too narrow, too specific, or it simply got lost next to the illustrations and other line-based elements.

Also, I couldn‚Äôt find a symbol that could truly represent the full scope of what the organization does ‚Äî they don‚Äôt just operate a helpline, but also provide chat support, organize awareness campaigns, and hold offline events. I didn‚Äôt want the logo to suggest only one type of service, like their old one, which used a phone  icon. 

That‚Äôs why the logo ended up being the last part of the design process. By that point, the visual identity was already developed, and I realized that any symbolic logo would visually compete with everything else.

So I decided to go with a typographic solution. The final logo features a stylized ‚ÄúZ‚Äù placed between the words ‚ÄúCesta‚Äù and ‚ÄúKrize‚Äù ‚Äî shaped like a curved line that represents a path. It connects the idea of movement and support in a subtle, flexible way.

## Lines That Guide, Colors That Calm, Faces That Speak

The visual identity is built around the line ‚Äî a soft, curved path that guides the eye and appears in every part of the system. It symbolizes movement, progress, and connection.

Colors are used for clarity and tone:  
- **Green** = adult helpline  
- **Blue** = children‚Äôs helpline  
Both have lighter secondary tones for flexibility.

Illustrations play a central role ‚Äî **simple drawings of girls and boys** that express a range of emotions ‚Äî from sadness to happiness. These illustrations help make the identity more human, accessible, and emotionally engaging without feeling too literal or overwhelming.

## Bringing It All Together  
I applied the identity to all key touchpoints:

- **New website** clearly dividing the two helplines  
- **Social networks** that blend line work, illustration, and tone  
- **Brochures and posters** for parents, children, and professionals  
- **Motivational merchandise** that spreads awareness through small messages of hope

*Social media presence keeps the message consistent and accessible.*

*Merchandise spreads awareness and encouragement beyond the screen.*

## What This Project Taught Me: Empathy first, design second

This project taught me how to work with a sensitive topic and translate it into visual language with care and responsibility. It was also my first experience designing for a non-profit organization. Most of all, I learned how to create a clear, consistent visual identity for a very broad audience.
