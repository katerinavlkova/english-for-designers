Manifesto:

1. Design should have purpose:
  • aesthetic value is secondary to function
  • design should have to solve a problem or need

3. Freedom:
  • rules should not stop new ideas but encourage them
  • it helps us experiment, try new things and find original solutions 

5. Typography matters:
  • typography is important for more than just being easy to read
  • good use of fonts, spacing and layout mkes the message clear and attractive
   
7. Learning:
  • we need to keep learning to stay updated, because design is always changing
  • beaing open to new ideas and tools helps us grow and improve our skills

9. Consistency:
   • consistency helps create a clear and reliable experience
   • it makes all parts of the design work well together
   • it doesnt mean repeating the same thing, but creating patterns that make sense
