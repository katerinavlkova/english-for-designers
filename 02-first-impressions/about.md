## About Me:
Ahoj! I’m Kateřina Vlková, a graphic designer who believes every project starts with a story. I focus mainly on creating brand identities and web/app designs that not only look great but also help businesses connect with their audience.

Currently, I’m finishing my studies in Graphic and Media Design at PSCC, where I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, trying out different design methods and improving my skills. I’m always looking for new ways to learn, grow, and improve my work.

For me, design is about understanding. I take time to learn about each client’s vision, values, and goals so I can create designs that truly represent them. Whether it’s a logo, a website, or an entire brand refresh, I make sure my work is both visually striking and practical.

Let’s collaborate to create a design that makes your brand stand out!
