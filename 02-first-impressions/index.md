I created a new visual identity for Café Letka, a cozy and stylish café that blends tradition with a modern touch. The goal was to design something that reflects the café’s unique atmosphere while giving it a fresh, updated look. The identity features a hand-drawn logo and illustrations that match the café’s visual style. 

This new design helps tell the café’s story and connect better with its customers.

The goal of this project was to create a mobile app for Karpuchina Gallery, a small Prague gallery focused on emerging artists, to make its art more accessible. The app allows users to browse artworks, explore past exhibitions, and check the event calendar. 

With a simple, modern design that aligns with the gallery’s unique style, the app helps expand the gallery’s reach and provides a new way for people to engage with the art.

## 03: Redesign Visual Identity for FAMUFEST

The FAMUFEST is a student film festival in Prague, and for the 40th edition the theme was "Networks." This theme looks at how connections, both in the brain (neural networks) and in society, influence our emotions and how we experience art and film.

This was a school team project, and my main tasks included designing the logo, animating it, and creating the visual style. We focused on the concept of the retina in the eye, which tied into the "Networks" theme, and this idea shaped the overall visual identity for the festival.
