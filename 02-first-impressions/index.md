I created a new visual identity for Café Letka, a cozy and stylish café that blends tradition with a modern touch. The goal was to design something that reflects the café’s unique atmosphere while giving it a fresh, updated look. The identity features a hand-drawn logo and illustrations that match the café’s visual style. 

This new design helps tell the café’s story and connect better with its customers.

## 02: App Design for Karpuchina gallery 
2024 | App Design | Digital Design

The goal of this project was to create a mobile app for Karpuchina Gallery, a small Prague gallery focused on emerging artists, to make its art more accessible. The app allows users to browse artworks, explore past exhibitions, and check the event calendar. 

I designed the app and created its prototype. This included several elements, such as the home screen, event calendar functionality or the option to save events. The app’s simple, modern design reflects the gallery’s unique style and provides a new way for people to interact with and experience the art.

## 03: Redesign Visual Identity for FAMUFEST
2023 | Visual Identity | Class Project

FAMUFEST is a student film festival in Prague, and its 40th edition explored the theme “Networks,” focusing on how connections in neural networks and society influence emotions, art, and film.

My main responsibility was creating and animating the logo, but I also collaborated with the team to develop the overall concept and visual identity. We focused on the concept of the retina in the eye, which tied into the "Networks" theme.
