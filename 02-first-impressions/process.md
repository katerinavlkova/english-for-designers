# ***Expanded bio***
# 01:
Hi! I’m Kateřina Vlková, a graphic designer who believes every design should tell a story. I specialize in creating brand identities and web designs that help businesses connect with their audience in a way that’s memorable.

For me, design is a tool to communicate ideas clearly and effectively. I focus on understanding the needs of each client, their values, and their goals, to create designs that reflect their unique identity. Whether it's a new logo, a website, or an entire brand refresh, I make sure that the design serves both form and function.

Currently, I’m finishing my studies in Graphic and Media Design at PSCC, where I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, trying out different design methods and improving my skills. I’m always looking for new ways to learn, grow, and improve my work.
