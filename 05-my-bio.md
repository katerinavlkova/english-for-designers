# Hi, I’m Kateřina Vlková, a student and freelance graphic designer, specializing mainly in web design and creating visual identities.

## Expanded bio:

My name is Kateřina Vlková. I’m a freelance graphic designer studying Graphic and Media Design at the University of Creative Communication in Prague. I mainly focus on web design and creating visual identities.

I started in high school with Photography and Media, and that’s where I first got into graphic design. It immediately felt like the right choice for me. Photography still influences my style, but design is now my main focus.

I enjoy trying out new ideas, but I also make sure my designs stay clear and simple. I aim to bring each client’s vision to life in a way that works well for them.

Looking ahead, I want to keep learning and growing in this field. Like I mentioned in my design manifesto, staying curious and learning continuously is so important.
