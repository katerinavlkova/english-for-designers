***Hi everyone!***   
***I’m Kateřina Vlková.***

Graphic Designer. Web Design Fan. College Student. Photographer Since Forever. Creative Visual Thinker. Professional Perfectionist.

That’s a quick intro. But let me tell you the full story.

## My First Camera
My journey into creativity started long before school.
When I was just a tiny kid, barely able to walk properly, I was already walking around with a camera in my hand — capturing every little thing around me: family dinners, my toys or random objects.
At the age of six, I got my first big girl digital camera. It was pink (of course) and mine and felt like the best thing in the world.
I started documenting everything around me. It wasn’t about making perfect photos — it was just fun. And it made me feel like I could catch a moment and keep it forever.

## Why I Chose Art School
That love for photography stayed with me.
So I made a decision: I wanted to study something creative.
That’s why I chose to go to an art high school called Eduso.
There, I focused on photography and media.
I didn’t just learn how to use a camera — I learned how to think visually, how to tell stories through images, and how to create meaningful work with purpose.

Photography taught me how to see the world.

## A Shift Toward Graphic Design
But after graduation, something changed.
I loved photography, but I realized I wanted to do more than capture reality — I wanted to shape it.
That’s why I decided to study graphic and media design at college.
Today, I’m in my final year.
I’ve just finished my bachelor’s thesis, and I’m preparing for my final exams.
It’s been a journey — challenging, inspiring, and completely worth it.

## What Photography Taught Me About Design
Switching from photography to design wasn’t starting over — it was building on what I already knew.
Photography gave me a visual language — and graphic design gave me a way to expand it.
Here’s what photography gave me that I still use every day as a designer:

- **Composition:**  Both in photos and in design, the placement of elements is everything. Knowing where to put focus, how to balance space, and how to guide the eye is really important.

- **Framing:** In photography, you decide what’s in the frame and what’s left out. In design, it’s about using margins, grids, and negative space to create clarity.

- **Light and contrast:** Photography taught me how light creates mood and how contrast creates impact. I use the same ideas in layouts, especially in typography and color.

- **Emotional storytelling:** A good photograph tells a story. So does a good design. Whether it’s a poster, a logo, or a landing page — it should make people feel something.

- **Patience and observation:** Photography trained my eye. It taught me to look closely and notice small details, which makes me a more careful and thoughtful designer. The more you slow down, the more you see — and that makes your work better.

## Where I Found My Place
Over time, I found what I enjoy the most:
Visual identities and web design.

I love creating brand systems where everything works together — colors, typography, layout — all telling one clear story.
Web design especially excites me because it combines logic and structure with creativity and emotion.

And while design is now my main focus, photography never really left.
Sometimes I still take photos — for projects, for inspiration, or just because I can’t help it.
It’s something that stays with me — not as a job, but as part of how I see the world.

## What Design Means to Me (and Why I Keep Doing It)
To me, design is not just a skill — it’s a mindset.
It’s about listening, understanding, and solving problems visually.
It’s about emotion and clarity.
And it’s about people.

Whether I’m building a layout, creating a brand, or designing a website, I want it to connect with someone — even if just for a second.

My background in photography taught me that you can’t create anything meaningful without empathy.
You have to listen. You have to observe. You have to imagine yourself in someone else's place.

That’s what I try to bring into every project — designing not just for people, but with people in mind.

## Lessons Learned
From my first pink camera to my latest  design project, every step taught me something important:

- **Stay curious.**

- **Pay attention to the small things.**

- **Embrace mistakes — they often lead to the best ideas.**

- **Design for emotions, not just for the eyes.**

And I’m excited to keep going — learning, creating, and telling stories that matter.

***Thank you for listening.***  
***I’m looking forward to the stories we’ll create next.***
